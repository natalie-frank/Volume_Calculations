
Before running any of the files, run the script 'create_mex_functions.m'. This only needs to be done once.

The following scripts compute volumes of some interesting shapes along with diagnostic plots
1. calculating_volumes_simple_shpaes.m -- calculates volumes and produces diagnostic plots for some simple shapes
2. calculating_disks_partition_function.m -- computes the partition function for the configuration space of n hard disks radius r in a torus
3.
